          <h1>Crochet</h1>
          <p>
            I grew up playing with the crocheted doilies and Christmas ornaments
            made by my grandmother. Mamaw had every size hook possible, and she
            created some of the most intricate patterns. Probably the most
            notable would be Princess Diana's wedding gown for
            Barbie--Completely crocheted, down to the last detail. I still have
            the dress.
          </p>

            She taught me how to crochet as a girl, but I never did try it
            outside of our lesson. Around age 30, I became interested in
            learning. So, being impatient, I bought a hook and some yarn that I
            thought was pretty. I went to Pinterest and Youtube and started to
            find anything out there for beginners. But this didn't really work
            for me. I was not able to grasp what was actually happening between
            my hand, the hook, and the yarn. The next time I traveled home, I
            brought my materials to my grandmother and asked her to teach me
            again. This time I latched on, and it made so much sense having her
            guide my movements as I learned. It was all I needed!
